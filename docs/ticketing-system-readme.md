  - **External Events**: Link to external ticketing site

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/tickets/checkout`

Creates a Stripe Checkout session for ticket purchase.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "eventId": "event-id",
  "tierId": "tier-id",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "cs_test_..."
}
```

**Authentication:** Optional (supports guest checkout)

## Stripe Integration

### Checkout Flow

1. User selects ticket tier and quantity on event detail page
2. Frontend calls `/api/tickets/checkout` with event and tier info
3. API creates pending order in Firestore
4. API creates Stripe Checkout session
5. User redirected to Stripe Checkout
6. After payment, Stripe webhook updates order status to "paid"

### Webhook Handler

The webhook at `/api/stripe/webhook` handles:
- `checkout.session.completed` events for ticket purchases
- Updates `eventOrders` collection with payment status
- Records payment intent ID

## Security Rules

### Firestore Rules

- **Events**: Public read, admin write
- **Event Orders**: Users can read their own orders, create orders; admins can read all
- **Event RSVPs**: Public create, admin read

### Storage Rules

- **Event Posters**: Admin write, public read

## Future Expansion Hooks

The following features are planned but not yet implemented:

### 1. QR Code for Ticket Scanning
- Generate QR codes for purchased tickets
- Admin scanning interface for check-in
- Location: `eventOrders` collection could include QR code data

### 2. Geo Check-in for Musicians
- Allow musicians to check in at venue location
- Integration with attendance system
- Location: Could extend `/app/checkin` page

### 3. Subscription Discounts
- Apply member discounts to ticket prices
- Check user subscription status
- Location: Modify `/api/tickets/checkout` to check subscription

### 4. Media System Integration
- Link events to project media
- Display event photos/videos
- Location: Add `mediaIds` array to event document

### 5. Partner Organization Management
- Allow partner admins to manage their own events
- Organization-scoped event management
- Location: Add `organizationId` to events, update admin pages
